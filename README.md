# Fractal Tree Visualization

This project renders a recursive binary fractal tree using Python and Pygame. The tree is generated through trigonometric transformations, with each iteration drawing two branches from the previous node. Adjustable parameters allow customization of recursion depth and branch angles.

## Features

- Recursive binary tree rendering
- Adjustable recursion depth and angles
- DPI-aware, adapts to your screen resolution
- Real-time visual updates

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Pygame

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Run the main script to launch the visualization:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can interact with sliders and button to change angles or export the current fractal as an image.
