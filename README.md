# Binary Fractal Tree (Pygame)

This project renders a recursive binary fractal tree using **Pygame** and **trigonometric transformations**. Each iteration draws two branches from the previous node, producing a visually striking fractal pattern that mimics natural tree growth.

## Features

- Recursive binary tree rendering
- Adjustable recursion depth and angle
- High-resolution display scaling (Windows DPI-aware)
- Real-time rendering using the Pygame loop

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame
